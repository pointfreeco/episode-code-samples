 # Functional Setters Exercises

 1. As we saw with free `map` on `Array`, define free `map` on `Optional` and use it to compose setters that traverse into an optional field.

 2. Take a `struct`, _e.g._:

```
struct User {
  let name: String
}
```

 Write a setter for its property. Take (or add) another property, and add a setter for it. What are some potential issues with building these setters?

/*:
 3. Take a `struct` with a nested `struct`, _e.g._:

```
struct Location {
  let name: String
}

struct User {
  let location: Location
}
```

 Write a setter for `userLocationName`. Now write setters for `userLocation` and `locationName`. How do these setters compose?

/*:
 4. Do `first` and `second` work with tuples of three or more values? Can we write `first`, `second`,`third`, and `nth` for tuples of _n_ values?

 5. Write a setter for a dictionary that traverses into a key to set a value.

 6. What is the difference between a function of the form `((A) -> B) -> (C) -> (D)` and one of the form `(A) -> (B) -> (C) -> D`?
